<objective>
Qualitatively verify the CLAUDE.md rewrite meets all Phase 2 success criteria: under 100 lines, every line justified, no regressions, simplicity-first guard present. Update STATE.md and ROADMAP.md to reflect phase completion.

Purpose: Replace the dropped formal measurement plan (02-02 was originally "measure context burn") with qualitative verification per user decision. Confirm the rewrite achieved its goals and close out the phase.
Output: Verified CLAUDE.md, updated STATE.md and ROADMAP.md.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Qualitative verification of CLAUDE.md</name>
  <files>~/.claude/CLAUDE.md</files>
  <action>
Run the following verification checks against the rewritten CLAUDE.md:

**1. Line count check:**
Run `wc -l ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` — must be under 100 lines.

**2. "Every line justifies its existence" audit:**
Read the file line by line. For each non-blank, non-header line, answer: "Would removing this cause Claude to make mistakes I'd need to correct?" If the answer is NO for any line, flag it for removal.

**3. Simplicity First integrity check:**
Verify all 4 rules are present and unmodified:
- "Solve only what was asked -- no premature abstractions (only generalise at 3+ similar implementations)"
- "Don't add backwards-compatibility shims when code can just change"
- "Don't build for hypothetical future requirements or \"just in case\" configurability"
- "Validate at system edges only -- trust internal code"

**4. No-regression spot check:**
Verify these specific preferences are expressed clearly enough that Claude would follow them:
- British English in prose, American in code (not ambiguous)
- Medium autonomy (ask before significant changes)
- Feature branches + squash merge workflow
- Commit format: `type(scope): description`
- pathlib.Path over os.path
- Don't create ad-hoc .md files
- .git/info/exclude for CLAUDE.md and .claude/

**5. No-bloat check:**
Verify these are NOT present:
- No preamble or title before first section
- No meta-instructions about the config system
- No pointers to project-level overrides
- No instructions Claude follows by default (iterative work, etc.)

**6. Structure check:**
- File uses section headers for scannability
- No deeply nested bullet points
- Dense but readable

If any issues found, fix them in ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md and re-verify.
  </action>
  <verify>
All 6 verification checks pass. `wc -l ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` < 100.
  </verify>
  <done>
CLAUDE.md passes all qualitative verification checks: under 100 lines, every line justified, no regressions, no bloat, good structure.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Update STATE.md and ROADMAP.md for phase completion</name>
  <files>.planning/STATE.md, .planning/ROADMAP.md</files>
  <action>
**Update STATE.md:**
- Update "Current Position" to reflect Phase 2 complete
- Update progress bar and plan counts
- Add Phase 2 to performance metrics
- Add any new decisions to "Accumulated Context > Decisions" section (e.g., which communication style lines were removed, final line count)
- Update "Session Continuity" section

**Update ROADMAP.md:**
- Check Phase 2 checkbox: `[x]`
- Update Phase 2 plan checkboxes to `[x]`
- Update Progress table: Phase 2 row to "Complete" with date
- Update plan count in Phase 2 details (0/2 → 2/2)

**Update Phase 2 Success Criteria (in ROADMAP.md):**
- Criterion 1 ("under 100 lines"): note actual line count achieved
- Criterion 2: UPDATE the text of this criterion from "measurably under 10%" to: "Context burn reduced via line count reduction from ~50 to <100 target (qualitative, per user decision — no formal token measurement)". This reflects the user's locked decision that success is measured qualitatively (CLAUDE.md under 100 lines + every line justifies its existence), not via formal token counting or live session measurement.
- Criterion 3 ("no redundant instructions"): note verified via line-by-line audit
- Criterion 4 ("simplicity-first instruction"): note all 4 rules retained
  </action>
  <verify>
`grep "Phase 2" .planning/STATE.md` shows updated status.
`grep "\[x\].*Context Optimisation" .planning/ROADMAP.md` shows phase checked.
  </verify>
  <done>
STATE.md and ROADMAP.md both updated to reflect Phase 2 completion with accurate metrics and status.
  </done>
