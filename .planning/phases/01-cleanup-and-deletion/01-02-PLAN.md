<objective>
Delete dead code, archived files, disabled scripts, and any additional dead weight identified by a full repo scan. Establish that every remaining file serves an active purpose.

Purpose: The _archive/ directory, sync-project-agents.sh, and various temp/backup files are confirmed dead weight. A full scan may reveal additional candidates. This gets the repo to a clean state before rules condensation.

Output: Repo with only actively-used files remaining.

    Delete the confirmed dead weight:

    rm -rf _archive/

    # Disabled project sync script (replaced by project registry in Phase 6)
    rm sync-project-agents.sh

    ls .DS_Store 2>/dev/null && echo "FAIL" || echo "PASS: .DS_Store deleted"
    ```
  </verify>
  <done>_archive/ directory (7 archived agents) deleted. sync-project-agents.sh deleted. .DS_Store removed and added to .gitignore.</done>

  <name>Task 2: Scan for and remove additional dead weight</name>
  <files>
    docs/usage-guide.md (flag for Phase 2, do NOT delete)
    references.md (assess and delete if dead)
    TODO.md (assess and delete if superseded by .planning/)
  </files>
  <action>
    Perform a full repo scan for dead weight beyond the known list. For each candidate, assess whether it serves an active purpose.

    **Scan for:**
    ```bash
    # Backup/temp files
    find . -name "*.bak" -o -name "*.tmp" -o -name "*.orig" -o -name "*~" | grep -v .git

    # Empty directories (after other deletions)
    find . -type d -empty | grep -v .git

    # Check references.md content -- delete if stale reference list
    cat references.md

    # Check TODO.md -- delete if .planning/ docs supersede it
    cat TODO.md
    ```

    **Decision logic:**
    - **references.md**: If it's a stale link dump or notes file with no active purpose, delete it. If it contains useful reference material that's still relevant, keep it.
    - **TODO.md**: If all items are now tracked in .planning/REQUIREMENTS.md or ROADMAP.md, delete it. If it has unique items not captured elsewhere, keep it.
    - **docs/usage-guide.md**: Do NOT delete -- flag for Phase 2 context optimisation (it's 750 lines that may overlap with README).
    - **Empty directories**: Remove any that result from deletions in this plan.
    - **skills/ directory**: Check if empty -- if so, remove (Phase 6 will create skills).

    **Additional dead weight candidates from research:**
    - `.vscode/settings.json` -- keep (editor config, not dead weight, but note for .git/info/exclude)
    - `.claude/settings.local.json` -- check content, keep if it has active config

    Log what you assessed and why you kept/deleted each item.

    # No empty directories (excluding .git)
    find . -type d -empty | grep -v .git | wc -l
    # Should be 0

    # docs/usage-guide.md still exists (flagged, not deleted)
    ls docs/usage-guide.md && echo "PASS: usage guide preserved for Phase 2"
    ```
  </verify>
  <done>Full repo scan complete. All dead weight identified and either deleted or flagged for later phases. No backup, temp, or empty directory artefacts remain. docs/usage-guide.md flagged for Phase 2.</done>

After both tasks complete:

1. `ls -d _archive 2>/dev/null` should return nothing
2. `ls sync-project-agents.sh 2>/dev/null` should return nothing
3. `find . -name "*.bak" -o -name "*.tmp" | grep -v .git` should return nothing
4. `find . -type d -empty | grep -v .git` should return nothing
5. Every remaining file should have an identified purpose
</verification>

<success_criteria>
- _archive/ directory completely removed
- sync-project-agents.sh removed
- No .DS_Store, .bak, .tmp, or other temp files in the repo
- No empty directories remain
- docs/usage-guide.md preserved (flagged for Phase 2)
- Every remaining file has been assessed as actively needed
</success_criteria>

<output>
After completion, create `.planning/phases/01-cleanup-and-deletion/01-02-SUMMARY.md`
</output>
