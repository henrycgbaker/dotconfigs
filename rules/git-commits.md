# Git Commit Standards

## Conventional Commits

Format:
```
[optional]<type>(<scope>): <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

Type prefixes are optional - plain descriptive messages are also fine for simple commits.

### Types
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation only
- `refactor`: Code change without feature/fix
- `test`: Adding/updating tests

For miscellaneous commits, omit the type prefix entirely.

### Rules
- Subject line under 72 characters
- Imperative mood ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- No period at end of subject line

### Breaking Changes
Two options:
- Add `!` suffix: `feat!: breaking change`
- Add footer: `BREAKING CHANGE: description`

## Semantic Versioning

Follow MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH:
- **MAJOR**: Breaking changes (incompatible API changes)
- **MINOR**: New features (backwards-compatible)
- **PATCH**: Bug fixes (backwards-compatible)

Version tags: `v1.2.3`

### Version Bumping
- `feat` → minor version bump
- `fix` → patch version bump
- `feat!` or `BREAKING CHANGE` → major version bump

## Workflow Context

### On Feature Branches
- Commit messages can be informal (WIP, notes, etc.)
- Focus on working code, iterate freely
- No enforcement of conventions

### On Main (including squash commits)
- Full conventional commit format required
- Subject line under 72 characters, imperative mood
- Type prefix recommended for clarity

## AI Attribution
- Never include AI attribution in commits (Co-Authored-By, Generated by, etc.)
- Git hooks enforce this automatically
- Take ownership of all committed code
