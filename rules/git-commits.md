# Git Commit Standards

## Conventional Commits
Use the format: `type: description`

Types:
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation only
- `refactor`: Code change without feature/fix
- `test`: Adding/updating tests

## Rules
- Keep subject line under 72 characters
- Use imperative mood ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- No period at end of subject line
- Breaking changes: add `!` suffix (e.g., `feat!: breaking change`)

## AI Attribution
- Never include AI attribution in commits (Co-Authored-By, Generated by, etc.)
- Git hooks enforce this automatically
- Take ownership of all committed code

## Version Bumping
- `feat` → minor version bump
- `fix` → patch version bump
- `feat!` or `fix!` → major version bump
