## Simplicity First

- Solve only what was asked -- no premature abstractions (only generalise at 3+ similar implementations)
- Don't add backwards-compatibility shims when code can just change
- Don't build for hypothetical future requirements or "just in case" configurability
- Validate at system edges only -- trust internal code
