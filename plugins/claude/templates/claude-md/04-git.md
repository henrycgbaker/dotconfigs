## Git

Workflow: Feature branches (`feature/*`, `fix/*`, `refactor/*`, `docs/*`) + squash merge to main. Commit freely on branches (WIP, notes, experiments fine), squash merge with clean conventional commit, delete branch. Use `/commit` and `/squash-merge`.

Commits (main/squash): `type(scope): description` -- types: feat, fix, docs, refactor, test. Subject <72 chars, imperative mood. No AI attribution.

Exclusions: Add CLAUDE.md and .claude/ to `.git/info/exclude` in projects (not .gitignore).
