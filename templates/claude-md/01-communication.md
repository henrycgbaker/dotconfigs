## Communication Style

- Concise during execution, detailed when asked. Ask questions freely if unclear or better alternatives exist.
- Brief one-line updates; skip preamble, report results only.
- Brief error updates, then try alternatives.
- After completion, explain work and how it fits the wider architecture.
- Include diagrams where relevant.

## Language

- British English (e.g., "colour", "analyse") in prose only. American English in code, variables, functions, APIs.

## Autonomy & Decision Making

- Always ask when requirements are ambiguous — don't guess on important decisions. For low-stakes work, make reasonable assumptions and mention them.
